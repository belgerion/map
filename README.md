This project was taken from the AJAX course project and converted into knockout. The Streetview API was changed to a Map API and the WikiPedia API was changed to Flickr API.

I hereby confirm that this submission is my work. I have cited above the origins of any parts of the submission that were taken from Websites, books, forums, blog posts, github repositories, etc. By including this in my email, I understand that I will be expected to explain my work in a video call with a Udacity coach before I can receive my verified certificate.
